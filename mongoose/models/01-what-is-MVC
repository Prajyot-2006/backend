📝 In general

A model is a representation of some data and the rules for working with that data.
It’s part of the MVC pattern (Model–View–Controller):
Model = data + business logic
View = how it’s displayed
Controller = handles user requests


📝 In databases (like Mongoose or Django)

A model is basically a class that maps to a database table/collection.
It defines:
What fields/columns the data has
What types those fields are
Any validation or default values
Utility methods to query, insert, update, delete
So you interact with the model instead of writing raw queries.
