📝 What is Mongoose?
=> Mongoose is a popular Node.js library that makes working with MongoDB easier.


It provides:
Schemas – define the structure of your documents.
Models – classes you can use to create, read, update, delete (CRUD) documents.
Validation – automatically check data before saving.
Middleware/Hooks – run logic before/after saving, updating, etc.

So instead of manually doing db.collection('student').find(...), you define a model once and use clean methods like Student.find() or Student.create().


1st what we did is we installed package.json using npm init -y 
and then also installed express by using npm i express 
and also installed mongoose by using npm i mongoose to start coding


A model is a representation of some data and the rules for working with that data.
It’s part of the MVC pattern (Model–View–Controller):

Model = data + business logic
View = how it’s displayed
Controller = handles user requests
