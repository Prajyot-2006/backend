MVC : MVC is a software design pattern used to organize code in a clean, structured way.
It stands for Model – View – Controller.

Model → we keep schema's in model , Handles the data and database logic.
Example: Your enquiryModel in Mongoose (it defines how data is stored in MongoDB).

view → agar koi data render karana ho , view karana ho to isme dalte hai or Handles what the user sees (UI).
Example: HTML, CSS, frontend pages that show forms, tables, etc.

controller - iske andar ham functionality ko rakhte hai or Handles the logic between Model and View.
Example: Your Express routes (/api/enquiry-insert, /api/enquiry-update, etc.) — they take input, talk to the model, and send a response back.



Quick Analogy for Beginners:
Think of ordering food at a restaurant:
View = Menu card & waiter (what you see and interact with)
Controller = Waiter who takes the order to the kitchen and brings food back
Model = Kitchen where the real cooking (data handling) happens
