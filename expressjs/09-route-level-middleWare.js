/*
Route-Level Middleware
A route-level middleware is a middleware that runs only for a specific route â€” not for every request.
You attach it directly to the route instead of app.use() (which makes it global).

in the previous files where we learnt about middleware , that all was global middleware which means it will run for every route such as for homepage , /news /news/id etc
now we are learning how to call middleware fn only for specific route or a particular route
