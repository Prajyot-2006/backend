Types of Modules

1. Core Modules
Built-in modules provided by Node.js, such as fs, http, path, etc.
No installation needed.

2. Local Modules (your own files)
You can create any logic and export it.
for eg : addToCart() , update()

3. Third-Party Modules (installed with npm)
Installed using: npm install <package-name>
for eg : axios in react



we can make modules in React and aswell as in nodejs 
In react : we use import,export to create modules 
In nodejs : we use require concept to call a module
and in nodejs we have 2 types of exports : default export module and named export module both have lil bit different syantx
